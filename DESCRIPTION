Description: A wrapper for querying the MVCA's 'WISKI' databases via the 'KiWIS'
    'REST' API. 'WISKI' is an 'SQL' relational database used for the
    collection and storage of water data developed by KISTERS and 'KiWIS'
    is a 'REST' service that provides access to 'WISKI' databases via HTTP
    requests
    (<https://waterdata.quinteconservation.ca/KiWIS/KiWIS?datasource=0&service=kisters&type=queryServices&request=getrequestinfo>).
    Supports the entire query process- from metadata to specific time
    series values. All data is returned as tidy tibbles. This package made possible thanks to Ryan Whaley's 'kiwisR' (<https://github.com/rywhale/kiwisR>).
